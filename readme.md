## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
As previously explained, this website shows my skills in HTML and CSS with a number of important features. The website consists of three primary pages: a landing page, two gallery sites that feature products from my chosen brand, and a third page that showcases other products. Every gallery page is devoted to showcasing different products, highlighting their distinctive features and design components. This arrangement allows users' exploration of a large collection, which helps them understand the brand's offers in greater detail.

Guiding Question:
- The project consists of two galleries of different products and their descriptions.
- The purpose of seatwork 4 is to enhance my proficiency in html and css in creating feature pages.
- Hover animation
- Accordion gallery with description
